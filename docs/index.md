*The Unix that grew up with us.*

Back in the school labs of the ’80s, Unix felt like pure magic: shared terminals, wall messages, tiny communities working together in real time.  
Then we went home… and our personal computers felt stiff, lonely, limited.

We grew up — and so did that old dream:

> **What if Unix had evolved the way we imagined back then?**

**YoUNiX** is that *“what if.”*  
A system that keeps the classic Unix soul but lives as a modern environment: fast, clean, friendly.  
A place where a TUI isn’t a compromise — it’s a choice that makes everything smoother.  
A desktop shaped around you, not the other way around.

Here everything is simple:  
**write, search, note, choose, update, configure** — with rhythm and ease.

YoUNiX isn’t trying to impress you.  
It’s here to serve you.  
To bring back the feeling of exploration.  
To make everyday computing a bit more *fun.*

Welcome.  
Grab a seat.  
Play. Explore. Build — today.
