If you want, I can **draft an actual YoUNiX shell script skeleton** using `fzf --reverse --preview` that implements **main menu + unit converter sub-menu + mini manuals**, so you can just fill in the calculation logic.

Do you want me to do that next?
Perfect, now we’re talking—this can be really slick in a terminal. Here’s a conceptual mockup for your YoUNiX calculator UI using an **fzf-style menu with previews**. I’ll describe it step by step so you can visualize it:
